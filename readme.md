# Minecraft Server Backup Tool (Fabric)

### How to use:
- Set up `SERVER_DIRECTORY` and `BACKUP_DIRECTORY` in `config.cfg`
- Run main.py with python

### TODO:
- Make better config with presets for backups (choosing how many files to backup)
- Add a progress bar
- Switch to `zipfile` from `shutil` library
